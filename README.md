### I'm currently working on..

- A simple todo using convex for my backend/database
- A Full-Stack Native Application (PERN) for a Kisok app. I also want to use React Native Paper for the UI. 
  

### New techs I'm learning..
- Convex
- MobX
- Docker

### I'm thinking about building...
- Migrating the above cricket scorer to Redux. It currently uses React Context which in hindsight is a bit messy for the app size
- A memory game to practise some state management. 
    - I'll add socket.io once finalised to make it 2 player
