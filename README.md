### I'm currently working on..

- A Cricket-scoring app that connects to firebase to store previous matches/teams/players - [see the repo](https://github.com/luiHoll97/cricket-scorer)
- Some more practise on Redux thunks using the GNews API by Google - [see the repo](https://github.com/luiHoll97/redux-gnews-api)
- A product with a friend! I cant reveal much, but it's a full-stack application using PERN, with React Native as our client portal.
    - At current stage, we're configuring Docker for our project. 

### New techs I'm learning..
- Firebase
- Chakra UI
- Immer
- Docker

### I'm thinking about building...
- Migrating the above cricket scorer to Redux. It currently uses React Context which in hindsight is a bit messy for the app size
- A memory game to practise some state management. 
    - I'll add socket.io once finalised to make it 2 player
