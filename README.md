### Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Lui, a full stack Software Engineer currently working in the Biotechnology industry.

Originally trained in the PERN stack, I have since branched out to other techs to find where my interests lie within the pandoras box of software development. Currently, I want to keep developing my skills within PERN, whilst also incorporating more Python work to keep my OOP fresh.

### Ongoing Projects
- [Aprendo](https://pypi.org/project/aprendo/) - A lightweight python package for improving/quizzing spanish vocab
- [fandanGO](https://pypi.org/project/fandanGO-aria/) - PYPI package for structural biology related metadata. Part of the EU project Fragment Screen 

### My Next Project
Through my work, I have spent time looking at software design. As a result, I now really want to create my own microservice project. I'm not bothered what it'll *do* at the moment, but the basic structure I'm aiming for is the following:
- FE : React (Ts)
- GQL gateway : Node (Ts) - make use of Apollo server
- Microservice a-z : Python w/ FastAPI / Flask (I haven't quite decided yet)
- DB : PSQL
